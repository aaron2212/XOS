General:
    - not enough config settings/options. Too many hardcoded values and assumptions that
      things were already configured a certain way
    - build a better way to handle and display errors

Filesystem:
    - superblock values were not updated when they needed to be (example: timestamp was 
      not updated when a file was added/removed)
